- if you click a page link while holding CTRL(or CMD on Mac) key, a new tab will be created (not visied yet)
- you can remove the tab by click the remove button in each tab
- you can double-click a tab to pin it. A pinned tab will not be replaced or be removed.
- you can drag & drop to reorder tabs
